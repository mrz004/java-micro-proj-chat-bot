This Chat Bot allows users to type their message/question and get answer from the AI Chat Bot. This is just a college project and does not fucuses on building of AI/ML model. This project is mainly focused on getting the user prompt, sending request to API, getting the response, parsing the response and displaying it on the screen using GUI interface.

1. Clone this repository
1. Set the environment variable `OPENAI_API_KEY` = your OpenAI API key
1. Set up project
   1. Use any IDE. I prefer `vs code`
   1. Use the `Extension Pack for Java` in vscode
   1. Add the `JSON Library` in `Referenced Libraries`. You can download it [here](https://github.com/stleary/JSON-java).
1. Run the code
   1. Open the `App.java` file
   1. Click the `run` button above the `main` method
